# REINFORCEMENT LEARNING - Intelligent Traffic Signal Control with Partial Detection
Implementation of the REINFORCE Deep RL algorithm for traffic control at road intersections 

This project aims at implementing a REINFORCE agent and visualize its effectiveness in various applications. 

**STEP 1** :Implement a generic REINFORCE and test it over gym environments 

- [`ReinforceAgent_MLP.py`](models/ReinforceAgent_MLP.py) : Simple 2 layer MLP version for discrete array input situations. Tested on [`CartPole-v1`](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)

- [`ReinforceAgent_CNN.py`](models/ReinforceAgent_CNN.py) : Convolutional Policy Network for image-based environments.
  - Uses a 3-layer CNN with frame stacking and softmax output for discrete actions.
  - Automatically preprocesses RGB observations into grayscale, resized frames.
  - Logs training progress to TensorBoard for easy visualization.
  - Tested on: [`MiniGrid-Empty-5x5-v0`](https://minigrid.farama.org/environments/minigrid/empty/)

To launch training and visualize performance (from terminal):
```bash
python ReinforceAgent_CNN.py
tensorboard --logdir=runs/reinforce
```


**STEP 2** : Integration into SUMO environment for traffic control at an intersection 

Modified from already built [DQN framework for SUMO](https://github.com/romainducrocq/DQN-ITSCwPD.git) by Ducrocq Romain
