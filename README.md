Implementation of a reinforce agent for traffic control at road intersections 

This project aims at implementing a REINFORCE agent and visualize its effectiveness in various applications. 

**STEP #1** :Implement a generic REINFORCE and test it over gym environments 

- <ReinforceAgent_MLP.py> : Simple 2 layer MLP version for discrete array input situations. Tested on [CartPole-v1]

- ReinforceAgent_CNN.py : CNN version for discrete tensor input (image treatment). Tested on [MiniGrid-Empty-5x5-v0]

**STEP #2** : Integration into SUMO environment for traffic control at an intersection
